## Maintenance

Network maintenance and security audits are done bi-anually by the end of the month, with offsite backups also included in the scope of the audit. This is currently done on the 31st of January and December

## Contributing

When contributing, please follow the design theme of the "Network" section of shapes in drawio and refrain from adding icons from other sources to maintain overall diagram consistency.

When adding devices, specify the IP address. In cases where DHCP is used, the host address should be left as x, as in **10.0.3.x**

While the diagram may keep tally of the total number of devices, per device inventory is tracked within [**INVENTORY.MD**](INVENTORY.MD). Please be sure to reflect any changes you've made in the diagram in this document as well
